User Story

    As someone deciding on which city to visit, I want to be able to see a list of restaurants from each city so that I can decide based on which has the best food.

How does it work now?

    This doesn't exist


How should it work?

    [DONE] - I should be able to see JSON data for all cities
    [DONE] - I should be able to see JSON data for all restaurants
    [DONE] - I should be able to see JSON data for restaurants in a single city

    [FOR THE JSON API]
    [x] need controllers for cities and restaurants
        [x] index actions (maybe show) for both controllers
    [x] need routes
    [x] need some seed data

    - I should be able to see an index page of all cities, with lists of restaurants for every city

Acceptance Criteria

    - Create a few cities and a few restaurants per city.
    - Visiting localhost:3000/cities should return all cities in JSON format.
    - Visiting localhost:3000/restaurants should return all restaurants in JSON format.
    - Visiting localhost:3000/cities/:city_id/:restaurants should return a given city and its restaurants in JSON format.
    - Visiting localhost:4000/ should show a web page that has an index of all cities, and information about the city + its restaurants.
      - There should be an overview saying how many restaurants the city has, along with the average star rating of all restaurants in the city.


Technical Details

    - Use a Rails back-end with a React front-end
    - A `City` should have a `name` and many restaurants
      - The city overview should be serialized
    - A `Restaurant` should have a `name`, `star_rating`, and belong to a city
